-- Input:

Now owl, your nest on the heights, the earth silent, the last star on the
fringe of the horizon, what hears your ear? The desire of your beak (and
heart) are rats, of course. You think eating rats is the highest art. So
you reside there, over me, and listen. I should be asleep, but my own ears
are covered by headphones. Finger on tablet, I do battle! Don't eat me,
I'm not a rat. But there are worse evils. Because even if you ate me, it'd
be okay--I have three lives left. Wait, no, I just won! Nevermind. Please
don't eat me.

are, ear
art, rat
